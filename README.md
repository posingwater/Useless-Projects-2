### Project Description
Our project consists of 2 "mini" projects. The first one is a simple To-Do list, while the other is a "Mood Analyzer"
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
- When designing the To-Do list, one thing came to mind. What could this world do less with? Annoying features.
- For the Mood Analyzer, we saw that people were getting too reliant on algorithms for their music. Like, damn dude. Learn to seperate yourself from the digital masters that serve you content.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
- So we made sure to load up the app with a whole lot of the annoying features. In case, life hasn't been keeping you on your toes, we sure will üòâ
- Thus, we brought out our Mood Analyzer (Patent pending). It brings out the revolutionary idea of completely randomizing your song choices according you your mood(not)!
